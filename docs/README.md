## 🚀 The Challenge
The team was struggling with a decentralized and slow legacy knowledge base (Google Sites). Information retrieval was inefficient during critical support calls, impacting KPIs like AHT (Average Handle Time).

## 🛠️ The Solution
I engineered a **Docs-as-Code** solution to centralize operations, strictly following SRE principles:
* **Performance:** Static site generation for <100ms load times.
* **UX/UI:** "Dark Mode" terminal aesthetic to reduce eye strain for operators.
* **Automation:** JS scripts to fetch real-time metrics and team birthdays.
* **Search:** Instant client-side search indexing.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Core:** MkDocs (Python)
* **Theme:** Material for MkDocs (Customized)
* **Scripting:** JavaScript (ES6) for dynamic dashboard widgets.
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Custom Variables & Animations).
* **Deployment:** Netlify (CI/CD).

## 📸 Features
* **Service Monitor:** Real-time KPI dashboard simulation.
* **Interactive Scripts:** "Copy-to-clipboard" functionality for support scripts.
* **Technical Wiki:** Syntax highlighting for troubleshooting guides.
